# Burger
https://sequelized-burgerz.herokuapp.com/

A burger logger web application that uses Sequelize, Node, Express, and Handlebars. It follows the MVC design pattern, uses Node and Sequelize to query and route data in the app, and uses Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### How It Works
* Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page--waiting to be consumed.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a button to eat it. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Burgers on the right side of the page have a delete button to remove it from view.
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.

### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Sequelize, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, MVC
